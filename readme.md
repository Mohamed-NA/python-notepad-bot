# Python Notepad Automation Bot

A Python script that automates data entry into Notepad. This project fetches the first 10 blog posts from the JSONPlaceholder API and saves each one as a separate text file.

This project was created for the TJM Labs Software Developer take-home assessment.

---

## Features

-**API Integration**: Fetches data cleanly from a live REST API.
-**Desktop Automation**: Uses `pyautogui` to control Notepad for data entry.
-**Robust Error Handling**:
    -Includes a fallback mechanism to write files directly if GUI automation fails.
    -Intelligently skips files that already exist to allow the script to be re-run without errors.
-**Clean Setup**: A detailed `.gitignore` file ensures no unnecessary files are tracked.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Download Executable (Easy Way)

For quick testing on Windows, you can download the standalone executable from the latest release. No setup is required.

**[‚û°Ô∏è Download `notepad_bot.exe` from the latest release](https://github.com/Mohamed-NA/python-notepad-bot/releases/tag/v1.0)**

### 2. Running from Source Code (For Developers)

If you prefer to run the script from the source code, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**
    -Python 3.x
    -Git

**Installation:**

1.**Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Mohamed-NA/python-notepad-bot](https://github.com/Mohamed-NA/python-notepad-bot)
    cd python-notepad-bot
    ```

2.**Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.**Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

**Execution:**

Simply run the main script:

    ```bash
    python notepad_bot.py
    ```

## Technical Choices & Discussion

-**Automation Library**: `pyautogui` was chosen for its simplicity and cross-platform compatibility for this specific task. An alternative like `pywinauto` could provide more robust control for complex Windows applications by interacting with UI element APIs instead of relying on screen coordinates.
-**Packaging**: `PyInstaller` was used to package the script into a single executable, fulfilling the project's delivery requirement.

## A Note to the Reviewer

Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I enjoyed working on this challenge as it allowed me to combine API handling, desktop automation, and robust error handling. I'm eager to discuss the technical decisions made here and how this approach could be scaled or improved in a real-world scenario.
